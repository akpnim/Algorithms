Python implementation of algorithms covered in the algorithms specialisation. These include:<br>  

(1) Karatsuba Multiplication [MergeSort]<br>
(2) Inversion Count [MergeSort]<br>
(3) QuickSort using first element as the pivot<br>
(4) QuickSort using last element as the pivot<br>
(5) QuickSort using a median of the first, last and median element as the pivot<br>
(6) Random Contraction Algorithm - computing the minimum cut of a graph <br>
(7) Kosaraju's Algorithm for strongly connected components (SCC) of a directed graph [CHALLENGING] <br>
(8) Dijkstra's Algorithm in O(m*n) i.e. the regular approach. (not heap based)<br>
(9) Median maintenance - using two Heaps to maintain the median of an incoming stream of numbers. <br>
